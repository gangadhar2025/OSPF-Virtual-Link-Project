🏆 OSPF Virtual Link Lab – End-to-End Network Connectivity
📌 Project Overview
This lab demonstrates how to implement an OSPF Virtual Link to connect an isolated area (Area 2) to the backbone (Area 0) and achieve full network reachability.

🎯 Objectives
✔️ Implement OSPF across all routers
✔️ Connect Area 2 to the backbone (Area 0)
✔️ Achieve end-to-end network reachability
✔️ Troubleshoot and verify OSPF connectivity

🛠 Lab Topology

🔍 Key Challenges & Solution
🚧 The Challenge:
Router4 (R4) was not an ABR, so it couldn’t advertise inter-area prefixes.

Router5 (R5) was unable to learn prefixes from Area 0 or Area 1, leading to an isolated network.

OSPF inter-area communication was broken, preventing proper routing.

✅ The Solution – OSPF Virtual Link
A Virtual Link was created between Router1 (ABR) and Router4 over Area 1, logically extending Area 0.

This allowed Router4 to function as an ABR, enabling inter-area route advertisement to Router5.

🔎 Troubleshooting & Verification
To ensure proper OSPF operation, the following checks were performed:
✔️ OSPF neighbor relationships were established
✔️ Virtual Link status was verified
✔️ OSPF routes were propagated correctly
✔️ End-to-end network connectivity was achieved

🎯 Final Outcome
✔️ Full network reachability achieved across all areas
✔️ Isolated Area 2 successfully connected to the backbone
✔️ Optimized OSPF network design for better performance
